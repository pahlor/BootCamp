# Kickstarting with Excel

## ** Overview of Project **

### * * Purpose * *

This project was to assess kickstarter campaign data for a variety of categories and countries. The purpose of this project was to analyze campaign outcomes, specifically for Theater campaigns and plays in particular. The goal of the analysis was to identify theater outcomes based on their launch date as well as outcomes for plays based on goal numbers and to identify any conclusions from the analysis of these numbers.

## ** Results **

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other possibilities we can look at and assess using this dataset are filtering the theater and play outcomes by countries to determine if there are any differences in performance and outcomes based on country as well as time of year.
