# Kickstarting with Excel

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

This project was to assess kickstarter campaign data for a variety of categories and countries. The purpose of this project was to analyze campaign outcomes, specifically for Theater campaigns and plays in particular. The goal of the analysis was to identify theater outcomes based on their launch date as well as outcomes for plays based on goal numbers and to identify any conclusions from the analysis of these numbers. 

## **Analysis and Challenges**

To perform my analysis, I first had to make sure all filters were cleared from my 'Kickstarter' spreadsheet. I then had to create new sheets within my spreadsheet to hold the analyses I wanted to do ("Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals").

### *Challenges and Difficulties Encountered* 



## **Results**

From our data on outcomes based on launch date, we can conclude the most successful months for plays are in the summer during the months of May and June. These are also the months were there are the most plays launched. 

From our data on outcomes based on goals, there does not appear to be any correlation between goal amount and success rate. Projects with very low goals and those with high goals (less than $1000 and greater than $50,000 for example) have similar rates of success (76% compared to 67%) and failure (24% compared to 33%).

One limitation of this dataset is that the total number of projects are not equally distributed within each goal band in the dataset. For example, excluding projects with a goal amount of $10,000 to $14,999, all other projects with goal amounts of $19,999 or below had at least 100 projects or more. When we examine the number of projects with goal amounts of $20,000 to $49,999, the total projects are 20 or less which is a lot less in comparison. There was only one project with a goal between $45,000 to $49,999. With a limited number of projects within certain goal bands as defined in the dataset, there is not much data for us to draw a solid conclusion about correlation between goal amount and project success or failure rate.

Other possibilities we can look at and assess using this dataset are filtering the theater and play outcomes by countries to determine if there are any differences in performance and outcomes based on country as well as time of year. Through this analysis we can compare performance based on time of year for each country as well as country to country performance comparison.
